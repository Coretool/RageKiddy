# clients

Clients are basically the backbones of RageKiddy since they hook it up to various tools for information gathering and penetration tests.

At the moment chameleon has clients for Nessus, Nexpose and OpenVAS.
Additionally there is a client for MSFDB and a client for the built-in nmap version (db_nmap).

A client featuring various `auxilliary` modules is in planning.
