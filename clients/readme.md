# clients

All supported clients can be found here.

Each client has at least a `load`, a `connect` and a `scan` function.

### `load`

This function loads the module into metasploit.

### `connect`

Connect is used to connect metasploit to a module.

### `scan`

Scan performs the default scan. Other scans may be implemented and found by their names.
